# Fractals
And it just keeps going

# About

This a remake of an old project I did as a student.
Looking back there is a heap of things that can be improved, and that is what I ammsetting out to do with this project.
Since we used a school library to code this project, it has to be rewritten using another library, in this case, I will use SDL.

With this remake I hope to improve the controls as well as the speed at which fractals render, as the old project was very slow because of it's lack of multithreading.
